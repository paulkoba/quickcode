# quickcode
Quickcode is a submission testing system inspired by competitive programming websites such as CodeForces. It was initially done as a project for the "Fundamentals of Object-oriented programming" course. Quickcode can dynamically generate problem pages from the database, safely execute user submissions in secure Docker containers, and store and provide the result of the validation of submission back to the user.

Quickcode is using Django framework.
